OUTPUT CSVs & K-MEANS LABELING:

***********************************************************
1. K-Means will randomly name cluster labels each time you run it
2. This means that though (mostly) the same markets will be in each grouping, THE GROUPINGS *WILL* HAVE DIFFERENT NAMES.
3. The groups on the CSV file are listed from top to bottom, as they are seen on the graph.
4. You need to reorder the columns on the csv file to match the colors on the graph.
	4a. Thus, the uppermost group (whatever color it is) should be the first group output group on the CSV file, and so on and so forth.
	4b. THEY HAVE TO BE MANUALLY REORDERED EVERY TIME THE NOTEBOOK IS RUN.
